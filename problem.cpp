//Problem 5 (conversion.cpp): Write a program 
//that will read in a length in feet and inches and output the
//equivalent length in meters and centimeters.
//Use at least three functions: one for user input, one or more
//for calculating, and one for output(console).
////Include a loop that lets the user repeat this
//computation for new input values until the user says
//he or she wants to end the program (user has to type exit).
//There are 0.3048 meters in a foot, 100 centimeters in a meter,
//and 12 inches in a foot.
